almost complete and updated list of articles I have read on the internet: https://kabiraj404.github.io/ReadingCatalog/ 

I was inspired from https://read.jamesst.one/, I tried to fork and use it but I was not able to replicate it, so I created my own style. 

My approach is simple: I use the bookmark in the browser to update the list, and that list updates the webpage.
